Comp 127 - Homework 0
===

# Overview

The goals of this homework are to:

- familiarize you with the development tools you will be using in this class, including VS Code, JUnit, Git and GitHub,
- give you a practice with the process for completing and submitting a homework assignment, and
- give you a send of how assignment grading and feedback works.

You will correct a simple class that incorrectly calculates the area of two shapes: a square and a circle.
Although the programming in this project is not challenging, the dev tools and submission process may be.
You will often encounter an unexpected challenge or two when learning a new technology! **Please ask for help** right away if anything seems confusing or broken. Now is the time to discover and clear up those problems, so that you have smooth sailing when the larger assignments start.

### Set up the assignment

1. Make sure you have completed the [Installfest instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RJuwG1kIlrMOu8zurt7vIXsyJJwpuaTZSJqE8J6R_sc/edit#).
1. Follow the steps in the [“Start the assignment” section](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zbYG1SOJvar52_XmtKRq0yOuDNIHS5jjaDn8Rz3_m7Y/edit#) of the Homework / Lab Procedures document.

### Run the tests (they should fail)

1. Open the project in VS Code.
1. Under the left Explorer Pane in VS Code, find the `tests` folder. Once inside access the AreaTest.java file and click on it.
1. Notice that VS Code shows several little green triangles throughout this file:  That is VS Code’s “Run” icon. You can choose to run just one individual test — but you want to run all of them! Click the double triangle that appears to the left of the first line of the whole class.
1. JUnit will run the tests. You should see a test results tree on the left pane that shows two failed tests.
1. Click on a test to see its error message.

### Fix the Area class

1. Open `src / edu / macalester` → `Area.java`.
1. Fix one of the two lines marked `TODO` in `Area.java`. (You may **not** change AreaTest.java.)
1. Rerun the unit tests. Look for a green “Passed” next to each of the two tests.
1. If the tests do not all pass yet, go to step 1.
1. Remove the `TODO` comments.

### Submit your work

Follow the steps in the [“Save your progress with a commit” and “Submit the assignment by pushing”](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zbYG1SOJvar52_XmtKRq0yOuDNIHS5jjaDn8Rz3_m7Y/edit#bookmark=id.ok7hybpqu919) sections of the homework procedure document.

Proclaim victory! You've finished your first homework assignment!
